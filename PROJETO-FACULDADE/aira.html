        <div class="text">
            <p><span class="highlight">Aira is the artificial intelligence</span> developed by our startup to go beyond what is expected of ordinary
                technology. It is not just a digital interface: it is the voice of your energy, the bridge between you
                and the data from your clean energy generation system.
                With advanced voice recognition features and full integration with IoT devices, Aira is able to collect,
                analyze, and interpret the data generated in real time by your renewable energy system. But it doesn't
                stop there. Unlike traditional dashboards that only show numbers, Aira transforms this technical
                information into clear, accessible, and intelligent speech, communicating directly with you in simple,
                functional language.
                Whether answering questions such as “What was today's energy production?” or reporting on system
                performance over different periods, Aira is always ready to talk, inform, and help you better understand
                how your energy is being generated and used—all in an intuitive, fast, and natural way.</p>

            <p>What <span class="highlight">Aira</span> does for you?</p>
            <div class="text-explain">
                <p><span class="highlight">Talk to you:</span> Aira uses voice recognition to answer questions such as:
                    “How much energy did we generate today?” or “How is the system performing?”</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Monitors data: </span> It continuously analyzes data from your solar panels
                    or other renewable sources,
                    providing insights into production, consumption, and efficiency</p>


                <p><span class="highlight">Send smart reports:</span> With just one command, Aira can send daily,
                    weekly, or monthly summaries by
                    email, with graphs, alerts, and personalized suggestions.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Create smart routines:</span> Want to receive a daily summary at 6 p.m.? Or a
                    complete analysis every
                    Monday? Aira can create automatic routines to keep you informed at all times.
                </p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Constantly evolving:</span> Aira learns with use. Soon, it will be able to: Suggest optimizations for energy
                    use. Notify you of anomalies or performance drops. Integrate with assistants such as Alexa and
                    Google Assistant. Accept voice commands to perform actions on the IoT system.</p>
